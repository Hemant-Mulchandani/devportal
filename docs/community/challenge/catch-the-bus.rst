Catch the bus - Aiven challenge with ClickHouse®
================================================

Welcome to Aiven's "Catch the bus" challenge, an easy way for you to explore Aiven for ClickHouse®. 

With the launch of Aiven for ClickHouse® we finally have the "C" for our KFC stack, the best combination of tools for real-time alerting and historic analytics. The stack utilises Apache Kafka®, Apache Flink®, and ClickHouse® to build up a robust, scalable architecture for getting the most from your data, whether it be batched ETL or real-time sensors.

For this challenge, we'll be using real-time data from `Digitransit <https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/4-realtime-api/>`_ to plot maps and find new insights. Digitransit provides real-time bus information and positioning data for busses in Helsinki. We've saved you a few weeks worth of data as a CSV to experiment with.

Let's dive right in.

Instructions
------------
The goal is to find the best bus routes between the different KFC restaurants in Helsinki.

1. Create an Aiven free trial account: `sign up for free <https://console.aiven.io/signup/email?credit_code=AivenChallengeBIGDATALDN22&trial_challenge=catch_the_bus>`_.

2. `Download the dataset <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B4Scsuz4hTx2Hbd9seMIb0dDgbo-b0bf/view>`_.

3. Spin up an Aiven for ClickHouse® service and load the dataset. Please see the `Aiven for ClickHouse® docs <https://docs.aiven.io/docs/products/clickhouse/getting-started.html>`_ for help with these steps.

4. Find the routes and plot them on a map. Here's a `notebook <https://github.com/Ugbot/Clickhouse-challenge/blob/main/mapping_book.ipynb>`_ with a few optional queries and a mapping library to get you started. You can also check out the `ClickHouse docs <https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/>`_ for advanced SQL information.
