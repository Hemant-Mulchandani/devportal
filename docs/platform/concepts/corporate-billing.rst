Corporate billing
=================

Everyone has their preferred way of paying for services. At Aiven, we give you the flexibility to receive invoices or pay by credit card for your Aiven services.

The **default billing** method for all new Aiven customers is a credit card charge at the end of the month for all charges accrued over that month. Each Aiven project is charged separately.

The billing unit for Aiven services is by the clock hour. The charges are automatically calculated based on the services running in your Aiven project. 

We offer corporate billing options for customers who prefer to pay by invoice. The standard corporate billing option is monthly invoices generated at the end of the month based on actual usage, similar to the credit card billing method.

The invoices for usage are automatically generated by our backend, and a PDF is emailed to the billing email address configured in the Aiven dashboard.

Prices for Aiven services are always defined in US dollars, but invoices can also be sent in other currencies. Invoices in different currencies are created based on the exchange rates on the date of the invoice.  Currently, the following currencies are accepted:

-  US dollars (default)

-  Euros

-  Pounds sterling 

-  Swiss francs

-  Danish kroner

-  Norwegian kroner

-  Swedish kronor

-  Australian dollars 

-  Canadian dollars 

Invoice must be paid within **10 days** of receipt by a wire transfer to Aiven bank account at Citibank Europe Plc:
