2. Give the new project a name.
3. Select an Account to add the project to.
4. In **Payment method** select a project to copy the billing details from, or select **Use a new credit card**.

When you create a new project, you will need to enable :doc:`billing for creating new services <docs/platform/howto/list-billing>`.
