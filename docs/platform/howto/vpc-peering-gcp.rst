Set up Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
=========================================================================

Once you've created a :ref:`VPC on the Aiven platform <platform_howto_setup_vpc_peering>`, you can follow these instructions to set up VPC peering on GCP.

1. Open your GCP Console.

2. Select **VPC Networks** and find the VPC that you want to connect to.

3. Click the project name and make note of the *Project ID*.

4. Under *VPC Networks*, make note of the VPC Network Name.

5. In the Aiven web console, select the VPC connection that you created.

6. Enter the project ID and VPC network name from GCP, then click **Add peering connection**.
This adds a new connection with the *Pending Peer* status.

.. note::
       Click the blue Pending peer icon and make a note of the Aiven project name and the network name.

7. In your GCP Console, go to **VPC** > **VPC network peering** and select **Create Connection**.

8. Enter a name for the peering connection and enter the same project ID and network name that you found on step6.

9. Click **Create**.

When the peering is successful, it is active in both the Aiven web console and your GCP Console.
