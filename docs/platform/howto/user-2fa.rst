Manage user two-factor authentication
=====================================

The two-factor authentication (also known as 2-Step verification or 2FA) in Aiven enables further securing logins by requiring a second authentication code in addition to the user password. Currently, Aiven supports two-factor authentication using the `Google Authenticator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator>`_ mobile application. Find in this article information on how to manage your two-factor authentication settings.

If you have lost access to your two-factor authenticator for some reason, like phone damage or loss, you will not be able to sign in. However, you can regain access to your account by resetting your password on the `Aiven web console <https://console.aiven.io>`_, and completing the password reset steps.

After that, you can enroll a new device as described in :ref:`Enable two-factor authentication <enable-2fa>`.
