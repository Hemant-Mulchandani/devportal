Increase metrics limit setting for Datadog
==========================================

Monitoring services and applications are essential to know whether programs work as expected. To get started with monitoring, see :doc:`Aiven and Datadog integration </docs/integrations/datadog/>`.

Sometimes, you cannot find the metrics you expected, or some values are missing on dashboards for large service clusters. This guide provides information on overcoming this limitation and getting more metrics from the integration. 

Identify that metrics have been dropped
----------------------------------------
The following is an example log of a large Apache KafkaÂ® service cluster where some metrics are missing and cannot be found in the Datadog dashboards after service integration. These metrics have been dropped by user Telegraf.

You can address this problem by following the steps below.

Configure the maximum metric limit
----------------------------------

You can set the maximum metric limit for services in the Datadog integration configuration, where the Datadog agents gather metrics via ``JMX`` using the ``max_jmx_metrics`` option. The value of this metric can be set to any value between 10 and 100000. The default value is 2000.

.. note:: Datadog may also limit the number of custom metrics that can be received, based on your pricing plan_ . 

The ``max_jmx_metrics`` is not exposed in the Aiven Console yet, but you can change the value for it from the `Aiven CLI <https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client>`_ using the following procedure:

1. Find the ``SERVICE_INTEGRATION_ID`` for your Datadog integration with

::

  avn service integration-list --project=PROJECT_NAME SERVICE_NAME

2. Change the value of ``max_jmx_metrics`` to the new LIMIT:

::

  avn service integration-update SERVICE_INTEGRATION_ID --project PROJECT_NAME -c max_jmx_metrics=LIMIT

.. note:: We recommend you gradually increase the value and monitor the memory usage on the cluster.
