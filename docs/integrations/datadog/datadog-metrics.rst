Send metrics to Datadog
=======================

This guide will show you how to send metrics from your Aiven service to your Datadog account.

Prepare your Datadog account
----------------------------

You will need a Datadog account and the following details handy:

* Which region your Datadog account is in, US or EU.

* A Datadog API key. Generate an API key by visiting **Organization settings** under your account menu, and then choose **API Keys**. The **New Key** button will give you an API key; you should copy this as you will need it shortly.

Configure the service integration endpoint
-------------------------------------------

This section need only be completed once for each Datadog account you wish to use. Multiple services can then use this service integration endpoint.

1. In the Aiven web console, click **Integration endpoints**. Select **Datadog** and then **Add new endpoint**.

2. Configure the endpoint by adding a name for this integration, and the API key you copied earlier. Check that the correct region is selected.

3. *(optional)* Add any additional tags that should be used when sending metrics to Datadog. You can `learn more about sending tags to Datadog in our guide <https://help.aiven.io/en/articles/5372887-adding-custom-tags-to-your-datadog-integration-in-the-aiven-web-console>`_ and these can also be added or edited later.

4. Choose **Add endpoint** to save this configuration.

Add Datadog metrics integration to your Aiven service
-----------------------------------------------------

Repeat these steps for each service whose metrics should be sent to Datadog.

5. Open the service overview page, and choose **Manage integrations**. Then choose the **Datadog** integration.

6. From the list, choose which Datadog integration to use, then select **Enable**.

.. Tip::

    If you're using Aiven for Apache KafkaÂ® you can also :doc:`customise the metrics sent to Datadog </docs/products/kafka/howto/datadog-customised-metrics>`.

7. Return to your Datadog dashboard and after a few minutes, you should see the data start to arrive from your Aiven service(s).
