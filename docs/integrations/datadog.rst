Datadog and Aiven
=================

`Datadog <https://datadog.com>`_ is a monitoring platform, allowing you to keep an eye on all aspects of your cloud estate. Aiven has integrations that make it easy to include an Aiven service in your Datadog dashboards.

Datadog for metrics
-------------------

You can send the metrics from any or all of your Aiven services to Datadog. The integration also supports adding tags to the data, either for all metrics, or on a per-service basis.
