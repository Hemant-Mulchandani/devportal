Send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch
=================================

Aiven enables you to send your service metrics to your `Amazon (AWS) CloudWatch <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/>`_. This article covers all the steps to enable this integration for your Aiven service.

Prerequisites
-------------

* An AWS account, and which region it is in.

* An Aiven account with a service running.

* An AWS Access Key and Secret Key. 
  
.. tip::
   
   To generate your AWS credentials, visit your AWS console under the **IAM dashboard** then click in **Users**, open the **Security credentials** tab, and choose **Create access key**. Click on **Download** as you will need this shortly.


Configure the integration
-------------------------

Your first step is to create the endpoint to be used between the Aiven service and the AWS CloudWatch. This setup only needs to be done once.

1. Click **Integration endpoints** in the web console, then choose **AWS CloudWatch Metrics** and **Add a new endpoint** or **Create new**.

2. Configure the settings for the new endpoint:

   * **Endpoint name** is how you will refer to the AWS CloudWatch metrics integration when linking it to an Aiven service.
  
   * **CloudWatch Namespace** where your metrics can be organized in different spaces. 
  
   * Your AWS credentials: **Access Key** and **Secret Key**.
  
   * Your AWS account **Region**.

3. To save this endpoint, click in **Create**.
