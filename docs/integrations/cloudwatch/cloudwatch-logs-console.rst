Send logs to AWS CloudWatch from Aiven web console
==================================================

You can find here the steps to send your Aiven service logs to the AWS CloudWatch using the `Aiven web console <https://console.aiven.io>`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need:

* An AWS account, and which region it is in.

* An Aiven account with a service running.

* An AWS Access Key and Secret Key. Generate the credentials by visiting **IAM dashboard** then click in **Users**, open the **Security credentials** tab, and choose **Create access key**. Click on **Download** as you will need this shortly.

Configure the integration
-------------------------

Start by configuring the link between the Aiven service and the AWS CloudWatch. This setup only needs to be done once.

1. Choose **Integration endpoints** in the web console, then choose **AWS CloudWatch Logs** and **Add a new endpoint** or **Create new**.

2. Configure the settings for the new endpoint:

   * **Endpoint name** is how you will refer to this logs integration when linking it to other Aiven services.

   * Your AWS credentials: **Access Key** and **Secret Key**.

   * Your AWS account **Region**.

   * **Log Group Name** where your logs streams can be grouped in a group on AWS CloudWatch. If this field is not provided, it will be generated for you.

3. Click in **Create** to save this endpoint.
