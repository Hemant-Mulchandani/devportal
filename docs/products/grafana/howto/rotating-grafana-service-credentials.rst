Rotating Grafana® service credentials
=====================================

In the interests of security, it is best practice to rotate credentials from time-to-time.

For Grafana®, a few steps need to be performed manually to do this. You will need to have access to a web browser,
and to have installed ``avn``, the `Aiven CLI tool <https://developer.aiven.io/docs/tools/cli.html>`_.

1. In the web browser, go to the `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_ page for your Grafana service.

2. Login to the Grafana instance at the Service URI displayed on that page, using the ``avnadmin`` credentials.

3. In the bottom-left of Grafana is a small avatar displayed above the help icon. Hover over it, and click Change password.

4. Change the password and make a note of it somewhere safe.

5. Login with ``avn`` and then run the following command to update the stored password in the console ::

    avn service user-password-reset \
      --username avnadmin \
      --new-password <new password noted above> \
      <service name>

   For example ::

       avn service user-password-reset \
         --username avnadmin \
         --new-password my_super_secure_password \
         my-grafana-service

6. Refresh the Aiven Console and the new password should now be displayed for the ``avnadmin`` user.
