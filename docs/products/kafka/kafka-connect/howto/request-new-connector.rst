=======================

If you know about new and interesting Apache KafkaÂ® connectors you'd like us to support, please email us at support@Aiven.io about it to help us shape the future roadmap. We will evaluate the requested connector and might add support for it.

Aiven's evaluation process for new Apache Kafka Connect connectors checks:

* license compatibility
* technical implementation
* active repository maintenance

.. Tip::

    When requesting connectors that are not on the pre-approved list through a support ticket, specify the target Aiven for Apache Kafka service you'd like to have it installed to.
