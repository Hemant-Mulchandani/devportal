Enable Apache Kafka® Connect on Aiven for Apache Kafka®
=======================================================

To enable Apache Kafka® Connect on Aiven for Apache Kafka® services, those should be running on business or premium plans.

.. Warning::

    Aiven provides the option to run Kafka Connect on the same nodes as your Kafka cluster, sharing the resources. This is a low-cost way to get started with Kafka Connect. A standalone Aiven for Apache Kafka® Connect allows you to scale independently, offers more CPU time and memory for the Kafka Connect service and reduces load on nodes, making the cluster more stable.
