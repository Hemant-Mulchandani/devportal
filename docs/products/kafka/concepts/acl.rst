Access control lists permission mapping
=======================================

Aiven for Apache Kafka® uses **access control lists** (ACL) and user definitions in order to establish individual rights to produce, consume or manage topics. You can manage users and ACL entries in the corresponding tabs of the service page in the Aiven web console as explained in the :doc:`dedicated documentation <../howto/manage-acls>`.

ACL structure
-------------

The ACL consists of **ACL entries**. An ACL entry is defined as the combination of:

* the username
* the permission given to the user 
* the associated topic(s)

The username portion of the ACL entry can be an Apache Kafka® service user name, or a string containing wildcards which could match multiple users. Similarly, the topic portion can be a single Apache Kafka® topic name or can use a wildcard pattern. The permission is one of ``read``, ``write``, ``readwrite`` and ``admin``.

The wildcards supported are:

* ``?`` matching a single character (equivalent to regular expression ``.``)
* ``*`` matching zero or more characters (equivalent to regular expression ``(.*)``)

The wildcards can be combined for more complex pattern matching:

* ``?*`` matches a single character, and then zero or more other characters (equivalent to regular expression ``(.+)``)

Aiven for Apache Kafka® evaluates each topic access against the ACL entries. If it finds a matching ACL entry, access is granted. If no entry matches, access is denied. Thus the order of the ACL entries is irrelevant.

Examples:

* username: ``abc``, permission: ``read``, topic: ``xyz``. User ``abc`` has read access to topic ``xyz``.
* username: ``analyst*``, permission: ``read``, topic: ``xyz``. All Aiven users with username starting ``analyst`` have read access to topic ``xyz``.
* username: ``developer*``, permission: ``read``, topic: ``test*``. All Aiven users with username starting ``developer`` have read access to topics starting with ``test``.

.. Warning:: 

  By default, Aiven adds an ``avnadmin`` service user to every new service and adds `admin` permission for all topics to that user. When you create your own ACLs to restrict access, you probably want to remove this ACL entry.

.. Note::

  When using the Aiven Terraform Provider, you can add the ``default_acl`` key to your ``resource`` and set it to ``false`` if you do not want to create the admin user with wildcard permissions.


ACL permission mapping
----------------------

You can define four types of permission for a particular topic or topic pattern. Note each permission is called differently in the Console when creating them (e.g. Consume) and in the ACL entries list:

* Admin / ``admin``
* Consume and Produce / ``readwrite``
* Consume / ``read``
* Produce / ``write``

The type of the permission dictates the actions the client is be able to perform. The following table contains a summary of the allowed action and a link to the Java APIs:

.. Warning:: 

    A user with the ``Admin`` permissions can create topics with any name, as the ``CreateTopics`` permissions is applied at the cluster level. 
    
    All other permissions related to a topic (``Alter``, ``Delete``) **only** apply to the topics matching the pattern that you specify.

The above mappings are subject to change and this article will be updated when that happens.

.. Note::

    By default, the number of users per service is limited to 50 in Kafka. Contact Aiven support if you need more users.
