You can visualise your ClickHouse data with the help of Grafana. Aiven can help you connect these services services.

Prerequisites

You will need:

2. Aiven for Grafana service, see how to :doc:`get started with Aiven for Grafana </docs/products/grafana/get-started>`

We'll use these values later in the set up. They can be found in your Aiven for ClickHouse service page, in connection information for HTTPS endpoint.
