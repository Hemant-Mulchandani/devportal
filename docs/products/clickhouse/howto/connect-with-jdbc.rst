Connect Aiven for ClickHouseÂ® with JDBC
=======================================

You can use `ClickHouse JDBC driver <https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-jdbc/tree/master/clickhouse-jdbc>`_ to connect external sources to your Aiven for ClickHouse database.

You will need Aiven for ClickHouse service, accessible by HTTPS. The connection values you'll need can be found in your Aiven for ClickHouse service page, in the connection information for *HTTPS endpoint*.

============================     ==========================================================================================================
Variable                         Description
============================     ==========================================================================================================
``CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_HOST``        HTTPS service host of your ClickHouse service.
``CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_PORT``        HTTPS service port of your ClickHouse service.
``CLICKHOUSE_USER``              Username to access ClickHouse service.
``CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD``          Password to access ClickHouse service.
============================     ==========================================================================================================

Connection string
--------------------

Replace ``CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_HOST`` and ``CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_PORT`` with your connection values::

    jdbc:ch://CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_HOST:CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_PORT?ssl=true&sslmode=STRICT


You'll also need to provide user name and password to establish the connection. For example, if you use Java::

    Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection("CLICKHOUSE_USER", "CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD");
