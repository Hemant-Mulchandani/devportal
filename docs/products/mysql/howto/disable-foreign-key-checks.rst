Disable foreign key checks
==========================

All Aiven for MySQLÂ® services have foreign key checks enabled by default helping in keeping referential integrity across tables. However, you might want to disable it for a particular session. For example, when migrating to an Aiven for MySQL you may face errors related to foreign key violations similar to::

  ERROR 3780 (HY000) at line 11596: Referencing column 'g_id' and referenced column 'g_id' in foreign key constraint 'FK_33b11dcfac6148578da087b07c2f388f' are incompatible.

The following explains how to temporarily disable Aiven for MySQL foreign key checking for the duration of a session.

Prerequisites
-------------

* The ``mysqlsh`` client installed. You can install this by following the MySQL shell installation `documentation <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html>`_.

* An Aiven account with an Aiven for MySQL service running.

Variables
---------

The following variables need to be substituted when running the commands. You can find this information in the **Overview** tab of your on your Aiven for MySQL service, under **MySQL** tab.

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 15 60
  :align: left

  * - Variable
    - Description
  * - ``HOST``
    - Hostname for MySQL connection
  * - ``PORT``
    - Port for MySQL connection
  * - ``PASSWORD``
    - Password of your Aiven for MySQL connection
  * - ``DB_NAME``
    - Database Name of your Aiven for MySQL connection

Check the foreign key check flag
--------------------------------

To check the foreign key check flag you need to:

* connect to your Aiven for MySQL with the following command::
    
    mysql --user avnadmin --password=PASSWORD --host HOST --port PORT DB_NAME

* run the following command to check the default configuration for your foreign key checks.

.. code:: shell

    SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'foreign_key_checks';

* verify that the foreign keys are enabled by default. This is the output you will see:

.. code::

    +--------------------+-------+
    | Variable_name      | Value |
    +--------------------+-------+
    | foreign_key_checks | ON    |
    +--------------------+-------+
    1 row in set (0.05 sec)

Disable foreign key checks
--------------------------

To disable the foreign key checks for the session, you give an additional parameter when you connect to your Aiven for MySQL using the ``mysqlsh``:

.. code:: shell

    mysql                   \
      --user avnadmin       \
      --password=PASSWORD   \
      --host HOST           \
      --port PORT DB_NAME   \
      --init-command="SET @@SESSION.foreign_key_checks = 0;"

Once again, we can check the current status of the foreign key checks by running::

    SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'foreign_key_checks';

As result, we can see that the foreign key checks are disabled for this session:

.. code::

    +--------------------+-------+
    | Variable_name      | Value |
    +--------------------+-------+
    | foreign_key_checks | OFF   |
    +--------------------+-------+
    1 row in set (0.04 sec)


The same flag works when running a set of commands saved in a file with extension ``.sql``.

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 15 60
  :align: left

  * - Variable
    - Description
  * - ``FILENAME``
    - File which the extension is ``.sql``, for e.g. filename.sql

You can paste the following command on your ``FILENAME``::

  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'foreign_key_checks';

Now you can set the ``init-command`` flag to disable the foreign key checks, and run the commands in this file like:

.. code:: shell

    mysql                   \
      --user avnadmin       \
      --password=PASSWORD   \
      --host HOST           \
      --port PORT DB_NAME   \
      --init-command="SET @@SESSION.foreign_key_checks = 0;" < FILENAME
