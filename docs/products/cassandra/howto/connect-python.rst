Connect with Python
-------------------

This example connects to an Aiven for Apache CassandraÂ® service from Python as the ``avnadmin`` user by making use of the ``cassandra-driver`` library. 

Pre-requisites
''''''''''''''

Install the ``cassandra-driver`` library::

    pip install cassandra-driver

Variables
'''''''''

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

==================      ================================================================================
Variable                Description
==================      ================================================================================
``HOST``                Host name of your Cassandra service. 
``PORT``                Port number used for connecting to your Cassandra service 
``USER``                Username used for connecting to your Cassandra service. Defaults to ``avnadmin`` 
``PASSWORD``            Password of the ``avnadmin`` user
``SSL-CERTFILE``        Path to the `CA Certificate` file of your Cassandra service
==================      ================================================================================

.. Tip::

    The Aiven for Cassandra CA certificate can be downloaded from the `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_, on the service detail page or with the :ref:`dedicated Aiven CLI command <avn_project_ca_get>`.

Connect to the database
'''''''''''''''''''''''
The following example establishes a SSL connection with your database cluster; replace the placeholders for ``HOST``, ``PORT``, ``USER``, ``PASSWORD``, ``SSL-CERTFILE``: 

.. literalinclude:: /code/products/cassandra/connect.py
   :language: python
