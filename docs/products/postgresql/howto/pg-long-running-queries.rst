Detect and terminate long-running queries
=========================================

Aiven does not terminate any customer queries even if they run indefinitely, but long-running queries can cause issues by locking resources and therefore preventing database maintenance tasks.

To identify and terminate such long-running queries, you can do it from either:

* `Aiven Console <http://console.aiven.io>`__
* `PostgreSQL® shell <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html>`_ (``psql``)


Terminate long running queries from the Aiven Console
-----------------------------------------------------

In the `Aiven Console <http://console.aiven.io/>`_, you can go to the **Current Queries** tab for your service.

On the Current Queries page, you can check the query duration and click **Terminate** to stop any long-running queries.


Detect and terminate long running queries with ``psql``
--------------------------------------------------------

You can :doc:`login to your service <./connect-psql>`  by running on the terminal ``psql <service_uri>``.  Once connected, you can call the following function on the ``psql`` shell to terminate a query manually::

    SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);


You can learn more about the ``pg_terminate_backend()`` function from the `official documentation <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html>`_.

You can then use the following query to monitor currently running queries::

    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state <> 'idle';


Client applications can use the ``statement_timeout`` session variable to voluntarily request the server to automatically cancel any query using the current connection that runs over a specified length of time. For example, the following would cancel any query that runs for more 15 seconds automatically::

    SET statement_timeout = 15000


You may check the `client connection defaults <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html>`_ documentation for more information on the available session variables.


Database user error
-----------------------------------------------------

If you run the above command using a database user not being a member of the database you're connecting to, you will encounter the error::

    ERROR:  must be a member of the role whose process is being terminated or member of pg_signal_backend

You can check the roles assigned to each user with the following command::

    SELECT r.rolname as username,r1.rolname as "role"
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles r 
        JOIN pg_catalog.pg_auth_members m
            ON (m.member = r.oid)
        JOIN pg_roles r1 ON (m.roleid=r1.oid)
    WHERE r.rolcanlogin
    ORDER BY 1;

where you would see the following::

    username |        role
    ----------+---------------------
    avnadmin | pg_read_all_stats
    avnadmin | pg_stat_scan_tables
    (3 rows)

To be able to check the database owner and grant the role, you can run the following::

    \l

which you should see the role::

       Name    |  Owner   |
    -----------+----------+
     testdb    | testrole |
    
To resolve the permission issue, you may grant the user the appropriate role as per below::

    grant testrole to avnadmin;
