Use the PostgreSQL® ``pg_repack`` extension
===========================================

``pg_repack`` is a PostgreSQL® extension that allows you to efficiently reorganize tables to remove any excess bloat the tables have accumulated. Reorganizing a table may take some time, but ``pg_repack`` tries to minimize the locks required to continue online operations.

.. note:: 
  Before you install the ``pg_repack`` extension, verify the version of the extension is supported on the PostgreSQL version you are using. For information on supported versions, see `pg_repack <https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/>`_ documentation.   

Variables
---------
The following variables need to be substituted when running the commands.

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 16 60
  :align: left

  * - Variable
    - Description
  * - ``HOSTNAME``
    - Hostname for PostgreSQL connection
  * - ``PORT``
    - Port for PostgreSQL connection
  * - ``DATABASENAME``
    - Database Name of your Aiven for PostgreSQL connection
  * - ``TABLENAME``
    - Name of the table you want to reorganize

Use ``pg_repack`` extension
---------------------------
To use the ``pg_repack`` extension: 

1. Connect to the database as ``avnadmin`` user, and run the following command to create the extension: 
:: 

  CREATE EXTENSION pg_repack;

2. Run the ``pg_repack`` command on the table to reorganize it. 
::

  pg_repack -k -U avnadmin -h <HOSTNAME> -p <PORT> -d <DATABASENAME> -t <TABLENAME>   

.. note:: 
  - Using ``-k`` skips the superuser checks in the client. This setting is useful when using pg_repack on platforms that support running it as non-superusers.
  - The target table must have a PRIMARY KEY, or at least a UNIQUE total index on a NOT NULL column.
