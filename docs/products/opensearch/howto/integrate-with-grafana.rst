Integrate with Grafana®
=======================

You can monitor and set up alerts for the data in your Aiven for OpenSearch® service with Grafana®. This feature is especially powerful if you're sending your Aiven service logs to an OpenSearch instance using :doc:`log integration <opensearch-log-integration>`.

Prerequisites
--------------
You will need:

1. Aiven for OpenSearch service.
2. Aiven for Grafana service, see how to :doc:`get started with Aiven for Grafana </docs/products/grafana/get-started>`.


Variables
--------------------
We'll use these values later in the set up. They can be found in your Aiven for OpenSearch service page, in the connection information.

========================================     ==============================================
Variable                                     Description
========================================     ==============================================
``OPENSEARCH_URI``                           Service URI of your OpenSearch service.
``OPENSEARCH_USER``                          Username to access OpenSearch service.
``OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD``                      Password to access OpenSearch service.
