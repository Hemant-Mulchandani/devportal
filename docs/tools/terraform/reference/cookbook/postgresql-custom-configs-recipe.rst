Deploy a PostgreSQL速 service with custom configurations
=======================================================

PostgreSQL速 has been a popular choice as an open source, relational database to run in production. This example shows how to use Terraform to create a single PostgreSQL service in a single cloud and region with some custom configurations applied to the service.

The following image shows that the `Aiven Terraform Provider <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs>`_ calls the Aiven API under the hood to create an Aiven for PostgreSQL速 service on the Google Cloud Platform (Europe):

      end
      id1 --> id2 --> id3

Let's cook!

The following sample Terraform script stands up the single PostgreSQL service with some custom configurations.

  Be sure to check out the :doc:`getting started guide <../../get-started>` to learn about the common files required to execute the following recipe. For example, you'll need to declare the variables for ``project_name``, ``api_token``, ``admin_username``, and ``admin_password``.

``services.tf`` file:

.. code:: terraform
  
  resource "aiven_pg" "pg" {
    project                 = var.project_name
    cloud_name              = "google-europe-west1"
    plan                    = "startup-4"
    service_name            = "my-pg1-gcp-eu"
    maintenance_window_dow  = "monday"
    maintenance_window_time = "10:00:00"
    termination_protection  = true
  
    pg_user_config {
      pg_version                = 14
      backup_hour               = 01
      backup_minute             = 30
      shared_buffers_percentage = 40
  
      ip_filter           = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
      admin_username      = var.admin_username
      admin_password      = var.admin_password
      
      ## project_to_fork_from  = "source-project-name" 
      ## service_to_fork_from  = "source-pg-service"   
      ## pg_read_replica       = true                  
  
      pg {
        idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 900
        log_min_duration_statement          = 1000
        deadlock_timeout                    = 2000
      }
    }
  }
  
When running a database in production, there are lots of fine tunings that need to happen. Let's go over some of these optional custom configurations used and understand when to use them. 

First, you can choose the PostgreSQL version using the ``pg_version`` parameter. A default version is chosen for you if you don't specify the version.
``backup_hour`` and ``backup_minute`` denote the hour and minute of the day (in UTC) when backup for the service is started. In this example, the backup starts at 1:30 AM UTC daily. ``shared_buffers_percentage`` sets the percentage of memory in your system that the database server uses for shared memory buffers.
To learn more about these settings, please refer to the PostgreSQL resource consumption docs mentioned under the **More resources** section. 

The ``ip_filter`` parameter filters incoming connections based on the mentioned IP addresses. The example of **"0.0.0.0/0"** is an allow-all value. 
If there are only specific IP addresses that you'd like to allow for clients, you'd put those IP addresses on this list. When you create an Aiven for PostgreSQL service, the database admin username and password are generated for you. You can set your preferred values by using ``admin_username`` and ``admin_password`` parameters.

If you wanted this PostgreSQL service to be a read replica of an existing PostgreSQL service, you could do that by declaring the ``project_to_fork_from``, ``service_to_fork_from`` and setting the value of ``pg_read_replica`` to **true**. Since the service in this example is not a read replica, these configuration lines are commented out.
If you choose to set ``pg_read_replica`` to **true**, then the custom ``admin_username`` and ``admin_password`` will no longer work because the configurations from the master node will be used.
 
If a transaction is waiting for a client query, there might be a time limit after which you want the session to time out. This is exactly what ``idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`` will do for you if you set a limit. Keep in mind that a value of zero, which is the default value, will disable the timeout.
Once you have some idea of how long a typical query statement should take to execute, ``log_min_duration_statement`` setting allows you to log only the ones that exceed some threshold you set. And then, you'll only see statements that take longer than the specified time to run. This can be extremely handy in finding the source of outlier statements that take much longer than most to execute.
The ``deadlock_timeout`` is the amount of time that PostgreSQL waits on a lock before it checks for a deadlock condition. The deadlock check is an expensive operation, so it is not run every time the server waits for a lock. The default is one second, but this can be increased for heavily loaded servers. All of these times are taken as milliseconds if specified without units.
