Cross-cluster replication with Apache Kafka速 MirrorMaker 2
==========================================================

From disaster recovery to isolating data for compliance reasons, businesses need to replicate data across their Apache Kafka速 clusters, and Apache Kafka速 MirrorMaker 2 is a perfect tool 
to do so. 

A single MirrorMaker 2 cluster can run multiple replication flows, and it has a mechanism for preventing replication cycles. This example sets up: 

* two Aiven for Apache Kafka clusters (a source and a target)
* an Aiven for Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 service
* two service integrations between the Apache Kafka cluster and the MirrorMaker 2
* a replication flow to move all the topics from the source cluster to the target cluster 

The `Aiven Terraform Provider <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs>`_ is used to create all the required resources in a declarative style. The following image shows a unidirectional flow with the Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 replicating all the topics from ``DC1`` (source Kafka cluster) to ``DC2`` (target Kafka cluster):

.. mermaid::

    subgraph DC2
    DC1.TopicA
    DC1.TopicB
    DC1.TopicC
    end
    subgraph MM
    replication-flow-->DC1.TopicA
    replication-flow-->DC1.TopicB
    replication-flow-->DC1.TopicC
    end
    subgraph DC1
    TopicA-->replication-flow
    TopicB-->replication-flow
    TopicC-->replication-flow
    end

Describe the setup
------------------

Here is the sample Terraform file that will spin up two Apache Kafka services, an Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 service and the MirrorMaker 2 service will be configured with two cluster alias pointed to the source and target Apache Kafka clusters. 

The service integrations ``source-kafka-to-mm`` and ``mm-to-target-kafka`` connect the Kafka clusters to the MirrorMaker 2 instance. The replication flow ``mm-replication-flow`` creates a unidirectional flow to populate the remote topics based on source 
topics. 

The ``".*"`` wildcard in the MirrorMaker 2 configuration means that all the topics from the source cluster will be replicated to the target cluster. However, since the flow is unidirectional, the ``topic-b`` will only be present in the target cluster (where it was originally created) and not the source cluster.

.. Tip::

    Be sure to check out the :doc:`getting started guide <../../get-started>` to learn about the common files required to execute the following recipe. For example, you'll need to declare the variables for ``project_name`` and ``api_token``.

``services.tf`` file:

.. code:: terraform

  resource "aiven_kafka_mirrormaker" "mm" {
    project      = var.project_name
    cloud_name   = "google-europe-west1"
    plan         = "business-4"
    service_name = "mm"

    kafka_mirrormaker_user_config {
      ip_filter = [
        "0.0.0.0/0"
      ]

    kafka_mirrormaker {
      refresh_groups_interval_seconds = 600
      refresh_topics_enabled          = true
      refresh_topics_interval_seconds = 600
    }
   }
  }

    source_cluster = aiven_service_integration.source-kafka-to-mm.kafka_mirrormaker_user_config[0].cluster_alias

  }

For Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 and Apache Kafka service integration, ``ip_filter`` is a specific configuration that whitelists certain ranges of IP addresses. This example of ``0.0.0.0/0`` denotes that all IP addresses are allowed.

.. Tip::

  In the target Apache Kafka cluster you will find: 
  
  * the topic named ``topic-b`` created via the resource ``"aiven_kafka_topic" "target"``
  * some internal MirrorMaker 2 topics starting with prefix ``mm2``
  * a heartbeat topic for the ``source`` Kafka cluster named ``source.heartbeats``
  * the replicated topic ``topic-a`` prefixed with the source Kafka cluster alias ``source``
