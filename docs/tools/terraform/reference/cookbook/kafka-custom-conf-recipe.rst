Apache Kafka® with custom configurations
========================================

This example deploys an `Aiven for Apache Kafka® <https://aiven.io/kafka>`_ service with some custom configurations, as well as a Kafka topic, a Kafka user, and an access control list (ACL) to allow fine-grained permissions about which topic that user can access, using the `Aiven Terraform Provider <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs>`_.

Before looking at the Terraform script, let's visualize the resources:

.. mermaid::

   flowchart LR
      subgraph Aiven-for-Apache-Kafka
      id4[[Aiven Kafka User]]
      id5[[Aiven Kafka User ACL]]
      end
      Producer --> Aiven-for-Apache-Kafka --> Consumer

Let's cook!
------------

Here is the sample Terraform script to stand-up Aiven for Apache Kafka and related resources. The script also performs some custom configurations on these resources.

.. Tip::

    Be sure to check out the :doc:`getting started guide <../../get-started>` to learn about the common files required to execute the following recipe. For example, you'll need to declare the variables for ``project_name``, ``api_token``, and ``kafka_user_name``.

``services.tf`` file:

.. code:: terraform

  resource "aiven_kafka" "demo-kafka" {
    project                 = var.project_name
    cloud_name              = "google-europe-west1"
    plan                    = "business-4"
    service_name            = "demo-kafka"
    maintenance_window_dow  = "sunday"
    maintenance_window_time = "01:00:00"
    default_acl             = false

    kafka_user_config {
      kafka_rest      = true
      kafka_connect   = false
      schema_registry = true
      kafka_version   = "3.1"

      kafka {
        auto_create_topics_enable    = true
        num_partitions               = 3
        default_replication_factor   = 2
        min_insync_replicas          = 2
      }

      kafka_authentication_methods {
        certificate = true
      }

      public_access {
        kafka_rest    = true
      }
    }
  }

  resource "aiven_kafka_topic" "demo-kafka-topic" {
    project                = var.project_name
    service_name           = aiven_kafka.demo-kafka.service_name
    topic_name             = "demo-kafka-topic"
    partitions             = 5
    replication            = 3
  }

  resource "aiven_kafka_user" "demo-kafka-user" {
    project      = var.project_name
    service_name = aiven_kafka.demo-kafka.service_name
    username     = var.kafka_user_name
  }

  resource "aiven_kafka_acl" "demo-kafka-user-acl" {
    project      = var.project_name
    service_name = aiven_kafka.demo-kafka.service_name
    username     = var.kafka_user_name
    permission   = "read"
    topic        = aiven_kafka_topic.demo-kafka-topic.topic_name
  }

Let's go over a few of these configurations and understand their functions:

``aiven_kafka`` resource configurations:

- ``default_acl`` parameter, when set to **true**, creates default wildcard Kafka ACL. This example sets this parameter to **false** and prevents the default wildcard ACL for resources.

- For ``kafka_user_config``, ``schema_registry`` is set to **true**, which enables the `Karapace Schema Registry <https://aiven.io/blog/what-is-karapace>`_ and ``kafka_rest`` allows you to view the messages in the topics from the Aiven web console when set to **true**.

- ``auto_create_topics_enable`` under ``kafka`` nested configurations enables the auto creation of topics when set to **true**. This means that a topic doesn't need to exist before sending a message.

- ``num_partitions`` will set the number of partitions for the automatically created topics.

- By default, the replication factor is 1. This example sets ``default_replication_factor`` to 2 and thus requires a minimum of two brokers. For production environments, a replication factor of 3 is recommended. 

- ``min_insync_replicas`` indicates that at least 2 replicas (brokers) should respond back if all replicas(brokers) are not functioning properly. When all replicas are functioning properly, this setting has no effect. 

- The ``certificate`` parameter under the ``kafka_authentication_methods`` nested configurations, when set to **true**, enables certificate/SSL authentication.

``aiven_kafka_topic`` resource configurations:

- ``partitions`` denotes the number of partitions to create in the topic, and ``replication`` sets the replication factor for the topic.

``aiven_kafka_user`` resource configurations:

- We are passing a preset username using ``var.kafka_user_name``

``aiven_kafka_acl`` resource configurations:

- This ACL allows **read** access to the ``demo-kafka-topic`` topic for the ``var.kafka_user_name`` user. 

.. Warning:: 

  By default, Aiven adds an ``avnadmin`` account to every new service and adds `admin` permission for all topics to that user. When you create your own ACLs to restrict access, you probably want to remove this ACL entry.

.. Note::

  When using the Aiven Terraform Provider, you can add the ``default_acl`` key to your ``resource`` and set it to ``false`` if you do not want to create the admin user with wildcard permissions.
